                Students at the University of South Carolina struggle to keep track of their retail 
                meal swipes because the balance is only available through a separate app.

                This diagram organizes key ideas into clusters to explore different aspects of integrating 
                retail meal swipe tracking into the Grubhub app, including technology, funding, challenges, 
                marketing, and future growth.

                The three sketches show how retail meal swipes would appear within the Grubhub app. 
                The first sketch shows how the retail swipes will be integrated into placing food orders. 
                The second sketch shows how the retail swipe tracker can be used and how it can help reduce 
                retail swipe waste across campus. The third sketches have potential features that 
                could be implemented.
